I'm Camille BENHAIM.  
Learned to code at Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp  🚂  
Love working on Machine and Deep Learning models.  
  
Current project : Minority report  
7M crimes indexed for the past 13 years. How to proceed ?  
- Represent crime locations in space and time with 3D arrays  
- Pass it through a Gaussian filter to spread the crime intensity  
- Feed the output video to a CNN autoencoder model made of CONV3D layers (Keras)  
- Predict the next 2 images of the video
